## F4IET Github

#### Hello all, My id is F4IET but my first Name is Alain. On some places I am also known as **BlackFlag**


* I am a Radio Amateur (ham radio), and RF is my main interest here.
* I build all my radio equipments. Even, testings and measurement equipments and devices.
* My Github share mainly hardware designs.


In particular I work on simple and cheap solutions. All not ham's in the world are richs women or men. And I like to demonstrate that a ham radio operator can reach the world with very few money. Until today, my most famous project is the Master Robert. It is a very simple design, very easy to copy but with a terrific efficiency. The goal was to build a ham transceiver for less than 100$ plus a small computer. This ridicoulsly simple design proved it was possible, with a so little money to catch the DXCC-100 Award.

These days I am working on a new project : A high level Ham station, competition capable, for less than 1000$ and with computer cost included in the package. It is much more tricky because it's using microcontrollers and advance SDR designs. 

That Github account have been setup for store the differents versions of hardware and software of the new project. Today, the repositories are private but of course they will be switch to Public when the project will be over.

I live in very Southern of France, in the Provence countryside.

Feel free to visit my QRZ page and my web site.

### Have fun and best 73.
