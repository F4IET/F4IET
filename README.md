## F4IET Github

### Hello all, My id is F4IET but my firts Name is Alain.


* I am a Radio Amateur (ham radio), and RF is my main interest here.
* I build all my radio equipments. Even, testings and measurement equipments and devices.
* My Github share codes of course but also hardware designs.
* In particular I work on simple and cheap solutions. All not ham's in the world are richs women or men. And I like to demonstrate that a ham radio operator can reach the wold with very few money.

I live in very Southern of France, in the Provence countryside.
